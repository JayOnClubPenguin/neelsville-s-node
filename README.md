First you have to create a new repl on replit.com and choose node.js for the template then paste everything in Index.js to the automatically created index.js file that gets created when you make the repl then add the files on the left side by pressing on the 3 dots and then selecting upload folder for the data and the public folder and  for the Blacklist.js, user-agent.js and for package-lock.json you select upload file. Once you have done all that you have to press run wait for it all to load it might take up to 1 minute to load but once its loaded, copy the link that gets generated above the new window that popped up and replace https://Neelsvilles-Node.user102030.repl.co on line 46(MAKE SURE TO KEEP /proxy/ !!!). Now you can past the link above the window into your search bar and it should bring you to your proxt website!(If the website doesn't immideatly load just wait cause it takes some time)
